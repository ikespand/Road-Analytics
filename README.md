# Road Analyzer
This is an android mobile application to detect pothole using object detection model. This is an extension of existing code from [YOLOv8 Live Object Detection Android Application](https://github.com/surendramaran/YOLOv8-TfLite-Object-Detector) (huge thanks to original author!). With the exetensions, app also takes a screenshot and log the GPS location for further analysis. There is SHARE button to export logs as csv file for analysis.
